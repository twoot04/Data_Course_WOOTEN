# Instructions ####
# Fill in this script with stuff that we do in class.
# It might be a good idea to include comments/notes as well so you remember things we talk about
# At the end of this script are some comments with blank space after them
# They are plain-text instructions for what you need to accomplish.
# Your task is to write the code that accomplished those tasks.

# Then, make sure to upload this to both Canvas and your GitHub repository




# Vector operations! ####

# Vectors are 1-dimensional series of values in some order
1:10 # ':' only works for integers
letters # built-in pre-made vector of a - z

class(letters)
LETTERS


vector1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)  #adding numeric values to a vector 
vector2 <- c(5,6,7,8,4,3,2,1,3,10)
vector3 <- letters # letters and LETTERS are built-in vectors

vector1 + 5 #add 5 element wise to ever element
vector2 / 2
vector1*vector2

vector1 * c(1,3,5)

vector3 + 1 # can't add 1 to "a"
class(5)



# Logical expressions (pay attention to these...they are used ALL THE TIME)
vector1 > 3
vector1 >= 3
vector1 < 5
vector1 <= 5
vector1 == 7
letters == "a"
letters != "c"
letters %in% c("a","b","c","z")
!(vector1 %in% 1:6) #will invert true falses



# Data Frames ####
# R has quite a few built-in data sets
data("iris") # load it like this

# For built-in data, there's often a 'help file'
?iris

# "Iris" is a 'data frame.' 
# Data frames are 2-dimensional (think Excel spreadsheet)
# Rows and columns
# Each row or column is a vector


dat <- iris # can rename the object to be easier to type if you want

# ways to get a peek at our data set
names(dat)
dim(dat)
head(dat)


# You can access specific columns of a "data frame" by name using '$'
class(dat$Species)
class(dat$Sepal.Length)

# You can also use square brackets to get specific 1-D or 2-D subsets of a data frame (rows and/or columns)
dat[1,1] # [Rows, Columns]
dat[1:3,5]

vector2[1]
letters[1:7]
letters[c(1,3,5,7)]


# Plotting ####

# Can make a quick plot....just give vectors for x and y axes
plot(x=dat$Petal.Length, y=dat$Sepal.Length)
plot(x=dat$Species, y=dat$Sepal.Length)


# Object "Classes" ####

#check the classes of these vectors
class(dat$Petal.Length)
class(dat$Species)

# plot() function behaves differently depending on classes of objects given to it!

# Check all classes (for each column in dat)
str(dat)

# "Classes" of vectors can be changed if needed (you'll need to, for sure, at some point!)

# Let's try
nums <- c(1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,6,7,8,9)
class(nums) # make sure it's numeric

# convert to a factor
as.factor(nums) # show in console
nums_factor <- as.factor(nums) #assign it to a new object as a factor
class(nums_factor) # check it
nums_factor+1
nums+1
# convert numeric to character
as.character(vector1)
as.character(vector1) + 5

# convert character to numeric
as.numeric(vector3)

as.numeric(as.character(vector1))
1:length(letters)
letters
#check it out
plot(nums) 
plot(nums_factor)
# take note of how numeric vectors and factors behave differently in plot()




# Simple numeric functions
# R is a language built for data analysis and statistics so there is a lot of functionality built-in

max(vector1)
min(vector1)
median(vector1)
mean(c(vector1,NA),na.rm = TRUE)
range(vector1)
summary(vector1)

# cumulative functions
cumsum(vector1)
cumprod(vector1)
cummin(vector1)
cummax(vector1)

# even has built-in statistical distributions (we will see more of these later)
dbinom(50,100,.5) # probability of getting exactly 50 heads out of 100 coin flips
?dbinom
rnorm(10, 10, 1)
hist(rnorm(10000,10,1))

# YOUR REMAINING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT (Fill in with code) ####

# 1.  Get a subset of the "iris" data frame where it's just even-numbered rows

seq(2,150,2) # here's the code to get a list of the even numbers between 2 and 150
dat <- iris
even <- dat[sequence(2,150,2),]
even

dat# 2.  Create a new object called iris_chr which is a copy of iris, except where every column is a character class

iris_chr <- as.character(iris)
iris_chr

# 3.  Create a new numeric vector object named "Sepal.Area" which is the product of Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width
vector1 <- dat$Sepal.Length 
vector2 <- dat$Sepal.Width
Sepal.Area <- vector1 * vector2


# 4.  Add Sepal.Area to the iris data frame as a new column
dat$Sepal.Area <- Sepal.Area
dat$Sepal.Area

# 5.  Create a new dataframe that is a subset of iris using only rows where Sepal.Area is greater than 20 
      # (name it big_area_iris)
dat$Sepal.Area > 20


# 6.Sepal.Area# 6.  Upload the last numbered section of this R script (with all answers filled in and tasks completed) 
      # to canvas
      # I should be able to run your R script and get all the right objects generated
